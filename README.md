Base line for AI platform. 

Proposed solution:
    1 - Create a wrapper around a API that is able to integrate with all model providers
    2 - Be able to customize System prompts 
    3 - Allow the end-user to send API requests into this platform
    4 - THe platform will accept this request, understand which model to use , what System prompt to use and where to send this request to (e.g OpenAPI, Gemini, etc)
